# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Work in Progress)

## Overview
This project is focused on building a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a heavily imbalanced dataset. The goal is to reduce false negatives while maintaining strong overall model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Class imbalance handling (SMOTE, under/over sampling)
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation using precision, recall, ROC-AUC

## Current Status
Currently working on model tuning and evaluation. Feature engineering and resampling pipeline are implemented and being refined.

## Planned Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Add additional models for comparison
- Improve feature selection and documentation

## My Role
This is a solo project I'm developing to sharpen my applied machine learning skills, with a focus on solving real-world data imbalance challenges.
